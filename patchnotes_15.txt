NEW FEATURES: 
-- 2 New Enemy Types: Mines and Gunners!
  -- Mines will spawn from the edge of the screen and chase after the player. 
  -- Gunners spawn at the right center of the screen and shoot bullets at the player's current position. They have 10 HP. There can only ever be one gunner at a time.
-- 4 New Control Presets: QWOP, SPACE-1, SPACE-2, ARROWS-2
-- New Scaled GFX option added! 
  -- Scales the game from the internal resolution of 960x640 to fit your monitor's current resolution.
-- More unique wave patterns! Increased from 2 to 8

BALANCE CHANGES: 
-- Player and Trash mob speed slightly reduced (now both 3.5 instead of 3.75 and 4.0)
-- Trash mob score reduced to 50 from 100
-- Backstab and CQC multipliers improved to 4x each from 2x (stack to 10x total instead of 5x)
BUG FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS:
-- Load time optimized (now only reads the settings.json file once instead of multiple times.)
-- Turbo Option now properly colored if enabled when the game launches. 
-- Code Refactoring! Much cleaner and more consistent to read.
