- While your ship is flipped, your bullets move at 2.5x speed and your ship moves at 1.25x speed. This affects existing bullets.
- You can only have 5 missiles out at once. Missiles disappear if they fly offscreen or hit an enemy.
- Beam charges have a much larger hitbox than missiles, move 50% more quickly, and pierce enemies, but are consumable. 
- You have 3 lives, this is displayed by the current amount of ships on your HUD
- Base score is 50 points per trash ship, 75 per mine, and 300 per gunner. This is increased by 1.5x if playing on Turbo Mode. 
- Killing an enemy in close range has a 4x score multiplier. (200 pixels or less --> calculated using pythagorean theorem) 
- Shooting an enemy in their back has a 4x score multiplier (i.e. if your bullet is travelling to the left).
- If both multipliers are active, you instead receive a larger score multiplier (10x instead of 8x)
- If on normal speed, the game will speed up by +10% (base) every 20 seconds and increase score by 5 points.
- If on turbo speed, the game will speed up by +20% (base) every 20 seconds and increases by 10 points.
- Every 5000 points earns you a beam charge. If you're at capacity (3), then you instead earn 1000 bonus points.
- Hitboxes for mines and trash mobs are circular, not rectangular, so you have some room to dodge and flank enemies.
- Hitboxes for Gunners and their bullets are pixel accurate, so you can die if you clip into their wings. 
- Movement is restricted in the top and bottom of the screen (60 pixels for each). Cinematic Bars will help cover this up.
- Mines will always follow your current position and can overlap, kite them for an easy beam charge.
- Mines will always spawn from the a left or center edge of the screen, so the middle or right will always be a safe spot.
- Mines will play a sound and blink faster if near a player (175 pixels distance) 
- Gunners will always spawn from the rightmost center of the screen before following your position.
- Gunners fire on a cooldown and will slowly move to your current y position, use this to your advantage.
- Gunners have 10 HP and take 1 damage from every missile shot, and 5 from every beam shot. 
- There can only ever be one Gunner on the screen at once, if a gunner already exists when another one would spawn, a new enemy wave consisting of mines and trash mobs will be spawned instead.
- There is enough room behind a gunner to perform a backstab
